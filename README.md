# Using Retail Data to Analyse Customer Behaviour
I am performing analysis and predictive modelling on a dataset of 1M customers from an arbitrary dataset. The aim of this project is to classify the main behavioural groups of customers based on their online shopping behaviours. The project also aims to determine the risk of customers churning and assess marketing and promotional effectiveness of different programs contained in the data set. 
Techniques explored include clustering, XGB boost and A/B hypothesis testing for marketing campaigns.
